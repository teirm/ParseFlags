Started writing parse_flags. Many methods unimplemented.

Learned how to do basic type erasure. Using it to make
code generic.

Wrote a C and C++ version to compare ease of use.
While the C++ api is more generic and a bit cleaner,
the C version is really simple and tiny.

Cleaning things up and getting it to build with CMake.

Original CMake build structure was ugly and showed
a poor understanding of targets. Went back to the book
and trusted examples and improved structure. Much 
cleaner now.
